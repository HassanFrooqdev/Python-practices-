# Real-world Scenario 1: Write a function that takes a list of employee salaries and calculates the average salary.
def calculate_average_salary(salaries):
    # Check if the list is empty
    if not salaries:
        return 0
    
    # Calculate the sum of all salaries
    total_salary = sum(salaries)
    
    # Calculate the average salary
    average_salary = total_salary / len(salaries)
    
    return average_salary

# Example usage
employee_salaries = [35000, 42000, 47000, 50000, 52000, 45000]

# Call the function and print the result
print("The average salary of employees is:", calculate_average_salary(employee_salaries))
